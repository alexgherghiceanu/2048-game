2048 Game using Ncurses

This project was created as part of my first year PCLP1 course, representing it's second assignment. We were tasked with creating a terminal-based recreation of the popular 2048 game in the C programming language, utilising the ncurses library.

Features:

- Start menu allows you to start a new game, resume a previous one or quit the program.
- Movement using the arrow keys.
- Ability to close the game and restart it at any time due to the use of the save_nr and save_score files to store the score and the state of the game board at any time.
- The game also presents the ability to play itself after a few seconds of user inactivity, reaching the end of the current round before exiting the programm.

Overall, after familiarising myself with the ncurses library, the project proved itself to be quite fun and an important step of my journey throught a Computer Science Degree.
